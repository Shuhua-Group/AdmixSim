Admix Models
========
1. Hybrid Isolation Model
1)Admixture started T generation ago, ancestral contribution from parental population 1 is m, and from parental population 2 is (1-m);

2)The length of continuous ancestral segment follows exponential distribution:

for ancestral population 1: 
  
  f(x;T,m)=(1-m)*T*exp(-(1-m)*T*x)
  
  for ancestral population 2: 
  
  f(x;T,m)=m*T*exp(-m*T*x)

2. Gradual Admixture Model
3. Continuous Gene Flow Model
